# Walleye

Made by Looseleaf Fonts. This is now open source, but I haven't done any research on what license I want to use, so that's not here.

## Installing

Download the ZIP of all the files:

[WalleyeComplete.zip](https://github.com/chuckmasterson/walleye/raw/master/WalleyeComplete.zip)

Extract it, and you've got .otf files, which your computer should be able to make sense of. Install it in whatever way you normally install fonts.

## Developing

You can choose from .ufo files or .otf files; they're both here. Be aware that I haven't done any work on this font in many years, and the .ufo files were automatically generated by FontForge.

Don't let the scent of abandonware scare you off, though; I'm proud of this font and it hasn't decayed since I finished it. There are no pictures as of yet, but I expect to have a chance to put some up soon.
